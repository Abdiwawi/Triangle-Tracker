# Triangle-Tracker
This is a webpage where a user is allowed to  input the lengths of the sides of a triangle,<br>
and returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle or if <br>
the sides cannot make a triangle at all. <br>
This are the guidelines:<br>
1.Equilateral: All sides are equal.<br>
2.Isosceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.<br>
3.Scalene: No sides are equal.<br>
4.NOT a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.<br>
